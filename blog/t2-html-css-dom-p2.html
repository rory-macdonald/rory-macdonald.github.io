          <h2>What is grid based design?</h2>
          <p>Grid based design is a website structure that essentially lays out your site elements into a framework that resembles a grid pattern (i.e. the positioning of boxes in both a vertical and horizontal context). If you look at virtually any webpage, the elements of the site fall into a "grid design" where you could draw a grid over top of the website to organise it's elements</p>

          <h2> Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
          <p>A responsive webpage will adapt it's design based on changes to the size of the browser window, orientation or platform. Nowadays, many internet users don't just access websites from their computers... They also access pages from their mobile phones, tablets and other devices. Each device can have a different screen size and orientation, so it is ever important that websites are able to respond to offer a consistent user experience across multiple platforms, devices and different sized browser windows. This can be achieved through responsive web design - and thus offer a great user experience across a wide range of devices, platforms and screen sizes.</p>

          <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
          <p>Semantic structure is where the tags used also tell a story about their importance/purpose on the page. It is a way of defining, organising and prioritising different elements of the site as it follows a convention used on other professional web pages. For example large page titles that are displayed would receive and h1 tag (suggesting this is the most important header). This is in contrast to using a p tag and then syling this individually. It is more specific.</p>

          <h2>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h2>
          <p>The google fonts website seemed very useful as a way of ensuring those who access the site see the same font and at the same time giving me a much broader range of fonts to design my pages with!</p>
