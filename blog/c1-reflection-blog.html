          <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h2>
          <p>I think it is fantastic how there is such a focus on openness - if you aren't afraid to ask the knowledge is there! There is an openness of communication and a cohort from a diverse background which encourages us all to be able to draw upon the experiences of others as well as our own to learn.</>
        </div>
        <div class="questions">
          <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
          <p>So far - I am really enjoying learning more every day, the feeling is addictive. However I can see how time management is a skill that is essential as there is much to learn in a relatively short timeframe.</>
        </div>
        <div class="questions">
          <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
          <p>I am quite a people person, so I am really looking forward to getting to know the rest of my cohort and make some new friends along the way as we venture on this learning voyage together.</>
        </div>
        <div class="questions">
          <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
          <p>Initially the course seemed to promote an open learning environment, and it definitely seems to be that way so far... what I didn't expect initially at least was how helpful the fellow student would be - there are some very talented and friendly people here :)</>

        <div class="questions">
          <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
          <p>Yes definitely excited, as mentioned earlier it is great to be able to call upon the help of others but also offer help in return as there is always much to be gained from learning-through-teaching! I am nervous in the sense that there is already a great deal of talent and skills within my cohort so I don't want to left behind!</>
