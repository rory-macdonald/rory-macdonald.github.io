    <h1>Time and Habits</h1>
    <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
        <p>Trying not to start my day thinking "I need to get everything done". Getting insanely micro and focusing on achieving small milestones. </>
      <h2>what did you find interesting?</h2>
        <p>Re-labelling things I "should" do as things I "want" to do. Becuase really they are one and the same, but labelling things to do as things I "should" do allowed for a bit of resistence and a feeling of being trapped to creep in. Also as a left-handed and right-brained person a lot of the discussion </>
      <h2>What worked for you?</h2>
        <p>Getting insanely micro and focusing on achieving small milestones really helped at tackling the larger task at hand!! Just squeezing in a bit of time here and there is the way forward!! Trying to acomplish everything in one foul swoop makes me feel overwhelmed ... I found myself to be much more productive handline just one thing at a time!</>
      <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h2>
        <p>Meditation is somthing that I have dipped my toe into in the past... after reading more about it I found the effect to be a very useful tool and life practice. I found meditation allows me to calm and over-active/over-worked mind and I think it will be a useful discipline to pursue over this course especially!</>
