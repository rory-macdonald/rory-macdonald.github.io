          <p>I have studied mindfullness a very small amount, but I liked the linkeage of how mindfullness can be used to bring the mind a strong, stable, and perceptive attention.</p>

        <div class="questions">
          <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
          <p>It is really profound how just two minutes is enough time to calm the mind and return more focused and centred. This allowed me to continue tasks with less apprehension and more focus. I feel this will be useful throughout the Dev Academy course!</p>
