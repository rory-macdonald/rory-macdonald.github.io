          <h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h2>
          <p>Think of all of these things in terms of a movie.</p>
          <p>The HTML would set out the basic structure of the movie e.g. the script. It would outline the scenes of the movie, the dialogue, the basic characters and their names etc.</p>
          <p>CSS would then set out the costumes/make-up/hair for the characters, music, sound effects, lighting, camera angles and timing of each scene.</p>
          <p>The DOM would be sitting in the directors chair, where you get the whole picture of what is happening in the movie. That is to say, you can see and make changes to the "behind the scenes" (lighting, camera angles, duration etc.) and then this effects what is in front of the camera.</p>

          <h2>What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>
          <p>This is a way to look at the design mock-up of a website and section each are off into it's own box. Once the design is divided up into boxes we can then proceed to build the page box by box, adding elements and content within each - as well as organising the smaller boxes withn the larger ones.</p>

          <h2>What is the box model?</h2>
          <p>As all aspects of the webpage can be seen to be contained within a box, the box model looks at how we can influence the constuction of each box to fine tune the layout of the website content. For example, we may add padding to protect the content from the outer edges of the box. We may add a border to create solid walls for the box. Sometimes we don't want the boxes right next to each other on the page - so we add a margin. By understanding the box model we have the ability to fine tune the layout of the elements on our page.</p>
